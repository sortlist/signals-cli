# Signals CLI Skill

Signals is a lead intelligence platform that monitors sources (LinkedIn, funding databases, etc.) and discovers new leads for sales teams. This CLI lets you manage businesses, signals, subscriptions, leads, and webhooks from the terminal.

## Setup

```bash
npm install -g signals-cli
export SIGNALS_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

## Concepts

- **Team**: Your organization. API keys are scoped to a team.
- **Business**: A company you're prospecting for. Each team can have multiple businesses. Leads, subscriptions, and webhooks are scoped to a business.
- **Signal**: A type of monitoring (e.g. "LinkedIn Company Engagers", "Recently Funded Companies"). Read-only catalog.
- **Subscription**: An active signal you've configured (e.g. "Track engagers on Apple's LinkedIn page"). You create, pause, resume, and delete these.
- **Lead**: An enriched profile discovered by a subscription. Contains name, email, company, LinkedIn URL, and more.
- **Webhook**: A URL that receives an HTTP POST whenever a new lead is discovered.

## All Commands

All output is JSON. Pipe to `jq` for filtering. Commands that operate on leads, subscriptions, or webhooks require `--business` (`-b`) to specify the business ID.

### Businesses

```bash
# List all businesses in the team
signals businesses:list

# Get a business with its Ideal Customer Profile
signals businesses:get <id>
signals businesses:get 1

# Create a business from a website (auto-analyzes name, description, ICP)
signals businesses:create --website <url>
signals businesses:create --website https://acme.com

# Create a business manually
signals businesses:create --name <name> [--website <url>] [--description <text>] [--icp '<json>']
signals businesses:create --name "Acme Corp" --website https://acme.com
```

### Signals (read-only catalog)

```bash
# List all available signal types
signals signals:list

# Get details for a signal type
signals signals:get <slug>
signals signals:get linkedin-company-engagers
```

### Subscriptions (your active signals)

```bash
# List all subscriptions for a business
signals subscriptions:list --business <id>
signals subscriptions:list --business 1

# Get a subscription with stats
signals subscriptions:get <id> --business <business_id>
signals subscriptions:get 42 --business 1

# Create a subscription
signals subscriptions:create --business <id> --signal <slug> --name <name> [--config '<json>']
signals subscriptions:create --business 1 --signal linkedin-company-engagers --name "Apple Engagers" --config '{"linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/apple/"}'

# Update a subscription
signals subscriptions:update <id> --business <business_id> [--name <name>] [--active <bool>] [--config '<json>']
signals subscriptions:update 42 --business 1 --name "New Name"

# Pause a subscription (stops scanning for new leads)
signals subscriptions:pause <id> --business <business_id>
signals subscriptions:pause 42 --business 1

# Resume a paused subscription
signals subscriptions:resume <id> --business <business_id>
signals subscriptions:resume 42 --business 1

# Delete a subscription
signals subscriptions:delete <id> --business <business_id>
signals subscriptions:delete 42 --business 1
```

### Leads (discovered profiles)

Each lead includes: `id`, `external_id`, `name`, `headline`, `job_title`, `email`, `phone`, `linkedin_url`, `profile_picture`, `location`, `company`, `company_logo`, `company_industry`, `company_size`, `company_website`, `company_linkedin`, `company_founded`, `connections`, `followers`, `icp_score`, `engagement_type`, `post_url`, `signals`, `subscription_ids`, `payload`, `triggered_at`, `created_at`. Fields are `null` when not available.

```bash
# List leads (paginated)
signals leads:list --business <id> [--page <n>] [--per-page <n>]
signals leads:list --business 1 --page 2 --per-page 50

# Get a single lead with delivery history
signals leads:get <id> --business <business_id>
signals leads:get 1234 --business 1

# Delete a lead (soft-delete)
signals leads:delete <id> --business <business_id>
signals leads:delete 1234 --business 1
```

### Webhooks

```bash
# List registered webhooks for a business
signals webhooks:list --business <id>
signals webhooks:list --business 1

# Create a webhook (with optional HMAC signing secret)
signals webhooks:create --business <id> --url <url> [--secret <secret>]
signals webhooks:create --business 1 --url https://example.com/webhook --secret my_secret

# Delete a webhook
signals webhooks:delete <id> --business <business_id>
signals webhooks:delete 10 --business 1
```

## Common Workflows

### Set up a new business and start monitoring

```bash
# 1. Create a business from a website (auto-generates ICP)
signals businesses:create --website https://acme.com

# 2. Note the business ID from the response, then browse signals
signals signals:list

# 3. Get details on a signal
signals signals:get linkedin-company-engagers

# 4. Create a subscription
signals subscriptions:create --business 1 \
  --signal linkedin-company-engagers \
  --name "Acme Engagers" \
  --config '{"linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/acme/"}'
```

### Check leads and export

```bash
# List recent leads
signals leads:list --business 1 --per-page 100

# Get full details for a specific lead (includes email, phone, deliveries)
signals leads:get 1234 --business 1

# Get all leads as JSON for processing
signals leads:list --business 1 --per-page 100 | jq '.leads[] | {name, email: .payload.email, company}'
```

### Set up a webhook for real-time notifications

```bash
# Register a webhook
signals webhooks:create --business 1 --url https://my-app.com/signals-webhook --secret whsec_abc123

# Verify it was created
signals webhooks:list --business 1

# Remove it later
signals webhooks:delete 10 --business 1
```

### Pause and resume a subscription

```bash
# Pause (stops scanning)
signals subscriptions:pause 42 --business 1

# Resume (starts scanning again)
signals subscriptions:resume 42 --business 1
```
